# tidyverse
Exercises demonstrating proficiency in the functions of multiple packages found in tidyverse.

Tidyverse is a collection of R packages that provides a consistent, user-friendly, and efficient set of tools for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. Tidyverse prioritizes making data science tasks in R more streamlined, with a focus on readability, reproducibility, and best practices. All three examples place emphasis on string manipulation, pattern matching, and regular expressions using the stringr package. 

The first example highlights pattern matching using stringr with Enable's word list. 

The second example highlights string manipulation using both World Bank's country identification and the gapminder package "country_codes". 

The third example highlights both pattern matching and string manipulation with added analysis on American Civil War Battles from Wikipedia.
